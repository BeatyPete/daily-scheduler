Could make it prettier, but functionality should all be there. The time is checked every 15 minutes to see if the time block colors need to change as well as the date. Should be easy to add more timeblocks. There's a small area on each timeblock on the left and right that can't be clicked which I could fix by messing with the on click function but I'll just leave it.
